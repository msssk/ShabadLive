				<h1>ShabadLive: live shabad search and display</h1>
			</header>

			<main>
				<p>ShabadLive aims to be the most flexible, beautiful, and easy shabad display software.</p>

				<h2>How? Let's start with the search interface</h2>
				<p>
					The <a href="http://igurbani.com">iGurbani</a> mobile app has a time-tested and proven interface for
					searching gurbani. ShabadLive will provide a very similar interface, usable on mobile devices as
					well as computers, so that the person controlling the display can sit comfortably with the sangat
					and enjoy the kirtan.
				</p>
				<div><button id="demo1">View Demo</button></div>

				<h2>What will it look like?</h2>
				<p>
					However you want! Some nice defaults will be included, but anyone with some basic HTML knowledge
					will be able to fully customize the display, including background, font, and colors.
				</p>
				<div><button id="demo1">View Demo</button></div>

				<h2>What are some interesting features?</h2>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Optimized text rendering: long lines will be split so the font can be larger and more
							visible
						</li>
						<li>Independently configurable displays: each connected display can display a different language</li>
						<li>Broad language support: Gurmukhi, English, Punjabi, Spanish, Hindi</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>When?!</h2>
				<p>
					That's where you come in! I have a window of opportunity to work on this full-time if I receive
					funding. I am happy to work on this as seva, but if that happens it will be in my limited spare time
					and probably take between 6 to 10 months. With funding it could be working by September!
